# Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to Nightowl React, read the instructions in `DEVELOPMENT.md` to 
set up the project.

All issues are logged in [Github Issues](). You can branch off of the `development` branch and create 
pull request when you have resolved the issue. All pull requests need to be approved by `Joshua Blevins`
and another developer.

If you have questions, you can join our [Slack]() or [Discord]() to ask them.
